# The Odyssey

This website showcases my visual interpretation of The Odyssey which acts like a storyboard for a potential film. All drawings were created by Victory Ma in January 2025. This project was originally intended as a final for Classics 124: The Many Faces of Homer, taught by Professor Moench at St. Olaf College. Website created by Victory Ma.
